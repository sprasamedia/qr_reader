# <b>QR Reader</b>
Arduino Project united technical college


## Components:

- <b> Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) </b>
- <b> QR code reader module (e.g., a barcode scanner compatible with Arduino) </b>
- USB cable to connect Arduino to the computer
- <b>Computer to run the HTML page</b>

## Outline Steps: 

- <b>Connect the QR code reader module to your Arduino board following the manufacturer's instructions. Usually, it involves connecting power (VCC, GND) and data (RX, TX) pins.</b>

- <b>Install the necessary libraries for the QR code reader module. Check the documentation of your specific module for instructions on installing the required libraries.</b>

- <b> Write the Arduino code that reads the QR code and extracts the student's name and roll number. You'll need to use the appropriate functions provided by the library to read data from the QR code reader. Below is an example sketch to get you started:<\b>


- <b>Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

- <b>Create an HTML page on your computer that will display the real-time information from the Arduino. You can use any text editor to create an HTML file. Save it with a .html extension (e.g., student_info.html).

- <b>In the HTML file, use JavaScript to read data from the serial port and update the page in real-time. Below is a simple example of JavaScript code that reads the serial port and updates the student information on the page:
- <b>Open the HTML file in a web browser. You should see the "Real-time Student Information" heading, and when a QR code is scanned, the student's name and roll number should appear below it in real-time.
