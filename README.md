# <b>QR Reader</b>
Arduino Project united technical college


## Components:

- <b> Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) </b>
- <b> QR code reader module (e.g., a barcode scanner compatible with Arduino) </b>
- USB cable to connect Arduino to the computer
- <b>Computer to run the HTML page</b>

## Outline Steps: 

- <b>Connect the QR code reader module to your Arduino board following the manufacturer's instructions. Usually, it involves connecting power (VCC, GND) and data (RX, TX) pins.</b>

- <b>Install the necessary libraries for the QR code reader module. Check the documentation of your specific module for instructions on installing the required libraries.</b>

- <b> Write the Arduino code that reads the QR code and extracts the student's name and roll number. You'll need to use the appropriate functions provided by the library to read data from the QR code reader. Below is an example sketch to get you started:<\b>
